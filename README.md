# Steam Setting Updater
## Features
* Mass update the AutoUpdateBehavior of games (allowing you to turn off automatic updating of games completely)
* Set a custom Download Throttle
## FAQ
* Why doesn't Steam display my custom DownloadThrottle in its settings?
  * Steam's GUI client is limited to displaying one of the pre-set drop down options. Although, the client will still attempt to respect your custom throttle.
